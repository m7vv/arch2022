## DDR5 SDRAM

Double Data Rate 5 Synchronous Dynamic Random-Access Memory (DDR5 SDRAM) is a type of synchronous dynamic random-access memory. Compared to its predecessor DDR4 SDRAM, DDR5 was planned to reduce power consumption, while doubling bandwidth.[4] The standard, originally targeted for 2018,[5] was released on 14 July 2020.[2]

A new feature called Decision Feedback Equalization (DFE) enables I/O speed scalability for higher bandwidth and performance improvement. DDR5 supports more bandwidth than its predecessor, DDR4, with 4.8 gigabits per second possible, but not shipping at launch.[6] DDR5 will have about the same latency as DDR4 and DDR3.[7] DDR5 octuples the maximum DIMM capacity from 64 GB to 512 GB.[8][3] DDR5 will also have higher frequencies than DDR4.

Rambus announced a working DDR5 DIMM in September 2017.[9][10] On November 15, 2018, SK Hynix announced completion of its first DDR5 RAM chip; it runs at 5200 MT/s at 1.1 V.[11] In February 2019, SK Hynix announced a 6400 MT/s chip, the highest speed specified by the preliminary DDR5 standard.[12] Some companies were planning to bring the first products to market by the end of 2019.[13] The world's first DDR5 DRAM chip was officially launched by SK Hynix on October 6, 2020.[14][15]
